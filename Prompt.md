i want to learn observability and practice it, with New Relic only, as it is used in my company.

For that i need a demo 3-tier MERN stack todo application on the left side, and on the left side all the button fields and that generate fake data

That dose generates fake data with a click of a different set of buttons from frontend

1. fake load generator
2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
3. Infrastructure Monitoring
4. Browser Monitoring
5. Synthetic Monitoring
6. Fake Log generation
7. Distributed Tracing
8. Network Performance Monitoring
9. API tracking

It could generate any data from frontend, my main task is the this demo application generates all different kinds of data and i could integrate or attach new relic and moniter in my relic account in newrelic.com

As of now i could only think of these things but i have hiered two developers frontend and backend, and i want to give them these instructions but i know this is not enough, can you make a details instructions that i could give them. please think of it make this application very ineresting.
